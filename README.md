Ultimate String-Array List
================

![Feature Image](/images/StringArrayList.png)

As an Android developer, I absolutely hate it when I have to worry about getting data for common use cases which involve things like list of countries, list of states or even letting the users enter their birth year. We see this in most android apps, especially the ones which have a form that a user needs to fill. Even if I do find the data , it is hardly in a format that I can use easily in my app. Honestly, this is :poop:!

So I decided to do this :poop: work for you :smile:! This repo will be a comprehensive list of common use cases like these with data in a format which is extremely easy to use in an Android app.

**We have enough things to worry about as an Android developer and collecting data for common use cases shouldn't be one of them!**

Why String-Arrays?
------------------

String-Arrays are extremely flexible to use and it is very easy to use them in any data structure that we might like. Don't believe me? Fine let me prove it to you!

Copy the string array you want to use and place it in the `res/values/some_file_name.xml` file. It would look something like this:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string-array name="months">
        <item>January</item>
        .
        .
        .
    </string-array>
</resources>
```
Now to access this programmatically, we can do this:

```java
//Get it in an array of strings
String[] months = getResources().getStringArray(R.array.months);

//Convert it into a list
List<String> monthsList = new ArrayList<String>();
    list = Arrays.asList(months);
```

You can also combine these string arrays for use in your apps. Let's say I want a key-value pair with the state codes as the key and the state names as the value. To implement this, I can do the following:

```java
String[] us_state_codes = getResources().getStringArray(R.array.us_state_codes);


String[] us_state = getResources().getStringArray(R.array.us_states);

final Map<String, String> m = new HashMap<String, String>();

for(int i=0;i<us_state_codes.length();i++){
  m.put(us_state_codes[i],us_states[i]);
}

```
As you can see, this is a really flexible way to access data and can be used in various scenarios.

**Note: This is extremely basic stuff but I wanted to show these examples for people who have not worked with string-arrays before.**
